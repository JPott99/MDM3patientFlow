Medical Ward Analysis:
Cases in which Medical Ward is the source:
  All MWs seem to feed into PlannedInvestigations, ExitHospital, and
	DischargeLounge. Asides from that, there are very occasional transfers to
	other wards, save for MedicalWard9 which sees a consistent output to various
	seemingly random wards. (AcuteMedicalUnit,ChartwellUnit,CoronaryCareUnit.PRUH
	(also somewhat served by 8),FarnboroughWard, HyperAcuteStrokeUnit.PRUH,
	IntensiveCare.HighDepUnit(slightly), SurgicalWard1, SurgicalWard2 (also 7),
	SurgicalWard3,SurgicalWard4,SurgicalWard5,SurgicalWard6,SurgicalWard7)

Cases in which Medical ward is the target:
  They all receive transfers from the AcuteMedical Unit. However, ward 9
	receives a very significant intake from EmergencyDepartment (while the others
	receive steady but small A&E intake). Ward 9 also receives a slightly larger
	amount from Clinincal Decisions.

Cases of transference from one medical ward to another:
  Almost every inter-MedWard transfer is from ward 9.

Simultion Cross-referencing:
 Looking at the number of patients within each MedWard in the simulation of
 patient numbers, ward9 has over 10 times the patients of each of the other
 wards.

The conclusion to this analysis, is that on the most part, wards 1-8 behave in
a similar way, whereas most of the intake into wards is via ward 9, which takes
most of the Emergency cases.


Surgical Ward Analysis:

Note: Ward 7 is labelled as Ortho, marking it out as potentially separate.

Source:
  Wards 3-6 have significant output into the discharge lounge, while all wards
	(1-7) have a significant output to ExitHospital

Target:
  1-2 receive a fairly large amount from AcuteMedical, 3-6 receive some, and 7
	receives a small amount. 4-6 receive a fair amount from the clinalDecisions
	unit. 3-7 receive a fairly large input from Farnbouroug around 30 weeks into
	the data. 3,5, and 6 get a fairly steady amount from intensive care. 3-6
	receive a large input from EmergencyDept, while 7 also receives some, though
	much less. A similar trend is observed with RecoveryWard1.

Both:
  Ward 3 transfers to 5-7 rather frequently. 4 transfers to 3, 5-7 alot. 5
	transfers to 6-7 significantly. 6 -> 3-5,7 somewhat. 7 -> 3 but infrequently.

Sim Count:
  1,2,6, and 7 all seem a bit smaller tham 3-5

Conclusion:
  For the most part the wards all seem to behave in a similar way, except they
	vary in size, so the smaller wards (1-2) never register significant activity.
	They could probably all be clustered into SurgicalWards without too much
	change.
